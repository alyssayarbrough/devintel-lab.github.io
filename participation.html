                <p><strong>Child care</strong></p>
                <p>
                    We have a waiting room with toys where other children can play during the study with one of our
                    research assistants. During scheduling, we will ask you if you need childcare so that we can arrange
                    for someone to be present. </p>
                <p><strong>Consent form</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Before we begin, we will explain to you exactly what you can expect from our study. You will be
                    given a consent form to sign should you agree to participate.

                </p>
                <p><strong>The study</strong></p>
                <p> We have several studies running in the lab at all times, so your visit may include some
                    combination of the below methods:</p>
                <p>
                    Wearable technology and play: You and your child will be equipped with eye tracking glasses and
                    hats, as well as motion tracking jackets. These wearable technologies help us measure natural
                    behavior during play. After set-up, you and your child will be given toys to play with together just
                    like you might at home! Set-up and play time takes about 30-40 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>Video watching: For some studies, we will show your child videos on a screen while we record their
                    eye movements. This often takes about 10-15 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>Parent forms: Many of our studies will ask you to fill out a form about words that your child knows
                    or ways that your child plays. These forms can take about 15-20 minutes to complete on our lab iPad.
                </p>
                <p><strong>After the study</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Your child will receive a thank-you gift for coming into the lab (like a small toy, a book, or a
                    lab t-shirt). We will then escort you back to your car or the lobby of the CRC.

                </p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">How long do the visits take?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Our experiments typically take somewhere between 30 minutes and 1.5 hours to complete. When you’re
                    invited to come into our lab, the researcher will tell you how long that study typically takes.</p>
                <p>
                    If you and your child need a break for any reason or need to stop altogether, we will absolutely
                    accommodate your needs.
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Will I be with my child during the visit?
            </button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Yes, you will be with your child during the entire visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any other children you may need to bring with you on our visit will be playing nearby with a trained
                    research assistant.
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">What days and times are you available for me to participate?
            </button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>We typically invite families to visit our lab between 9-6pm on Mondays through Fridays. However, we
                    are available in the early morning, evening, and on the weekend to best accommodate you and your
                    child’s schedule.
